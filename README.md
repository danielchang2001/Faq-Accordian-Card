## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This was my first javascript project at Frontend Mentor. I implemented a simple class toggle functionality for opening/closing the faq answers. I learned to have different active states in CSS that have different styling. I learned putting margin 0 for html and body to make it fullscreen, background gradients, hiding overflow.

### Continued development

I am working to master JavaScript.
